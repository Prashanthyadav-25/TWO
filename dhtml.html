<p id="p1">DHTML allows different scripting languages in a web page to change their variables, which enhance the effects, looks and many others functions after the whole page have been fully loaded or under a view process, or otherwise static HTML pages on the same. But in true ways, there is noting that as dynamic in DHTML, there is only the enclosing of different technologies like CSS, HTML, JS, DOM, and different sets of static languages which make it as dynamic.</p>
<p id="p2">DHTML makes a webpage dynamic but Javascript also does, the question arises that what different does DHTML do? So the answer is that DHTML has the ability to change a webpages look, content and style once the document has loaded on our demand without changing or deleting everything already existing on the browserâ€™s webpage. DHTML can change the content of a webpage on demand without the browser having to erase everything else, i.e. being able to alter changes on a webpage even after the document has completely loaded..</p>

The browsers which support the dynamic HTML are some of the versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer of version higher than 4.0. The DHTML is based on the properties of the HTML, javascript, CSS, and DOM (Document Object Model which is used to access individual elements of a document) which helps in making dynamic content. It is the combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and DOM. The DHTML make use of Dynamic object model to make changes in settings and also in properties and methods. It also makes uses of Scripting and it is also part of earlier computing trends..");
